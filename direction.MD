Duolingo makes language study feasible and easy. It provides various approaches and resources (i.e word recitation, article reading) to accelerate usersâ€™ language learning.

Customers tend to be foreign language learners who aim to study abroad/pass language exams/satisfy their personal appetite for literature and culture.

Duolingo has a minimalist interface by invoking a simplistic and game-esque interface that motivates the user to continue with their lessons. 

The infrastructure of Duolingo includes a web app through React/Django, a database that stores lesson and user data, and a content management system. 

It invokes LLM to assist users in lessons through explaining answers to problem sets (i.e. grammar, context).

We can deploy the Duolingo functionalities in a web application via Vercel and then deploy the database via AWS or Supabase.
