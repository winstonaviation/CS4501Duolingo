Duolingo makes language study feasible and easy. It provides various approaches and resources (i.e word recitation, article reading) to accelerate usersâ€™ language learning.

Customers tend to be foreign language learners who aim to study abroad/pass language exams/satisfy their personal appetite for literature and culture.

Duolingo has a minimalist interface by invoking a simplistic and game-esque interface that motivates the user to continue with their lessons. It is focused solely on functionality rather than complexity.

The infrastructure of Duolingo includes a web app through React/Django, a database that stores lesson and user data, an API service that handles calls to the LLM for summarization, and a content management system that distributes lessons.

It invokes an LLM to assist users in lessons through explaining answers to problem sets (i.e. grammar, context).

We can deploy the Duolingo functionalities in a web application via Vercel and then deploy the database via AWS or Supabase.
